# Blackjack-Game
This is a Blackjack game made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In this game, we made use of arrays, how we can make use of objects, conditionals mainly for loops as well as some
if-else operations.We also made use of logical operators mainly in the conditionals.

In this game basically , we made use of loops and arrays to store the card's value stored and as we keep 
on adding a new card , it will show the update simultaneously. We also made use of functions such as getrandom card
or get a new card when the player is asked whether they want to continue or not. we also make use of random  library
so as to select random number card. And as the rule goes, when our sum comes out to be 21 we display that appropriate winning message.
